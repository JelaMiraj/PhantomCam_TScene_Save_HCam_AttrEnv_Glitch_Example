# PhantomCam_TScene_Save_HCam_AttrEnv_Glitch_Example
 Example demonstrating apparent glitch-bug - Phantom Camera Host script lines 598-602 environment/attributes duplicate() seems rerolling resource IDs in .tscn muddying git commits.
 Hopefully this gets fixed. Was experienced with Godot 4.3 and Phantom Camera 0.7.3.
